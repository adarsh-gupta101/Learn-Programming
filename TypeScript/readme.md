The Complete Guide to TypeScript
================================

Get up and running with TypeScript: the heir to JavaScript
----------------------------------------------------------

What is TypeScript?
===================

TypeScript is a free and open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript.

> The foundation for TypeScript is JavaScript.

You begin by writing the TypeScript code. The TypeScript code is then converted into standard JavaScript code using a TypeScript compiler.

Why should you use TypeScript?
==============================

As it introduces optional types to JavaScript, our code will be less error-prone. Many companies told shifting their codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript helped them to have 50% fewer bugsüöÄ

Let's look at an Example:

```
**function getProduct(id)  
{  
return {   
id: id,   
name: \`Awesome Gadget ${id}\`,   
}** **}  
**const product = getProduct(1);  
console.log(\`The product is ${product.Name} \`);
```

If you do like this in JavaScript, unless you run the file, it will never show an error, when you do so it will show the result as this:

You can see that the property is _name_ and not _Name._ Here when you use typescript it will fetch the error before you stand a chance to run the file.

**Installing TypeScript**

```
npm install TypeScript  

```

**Running TypeScript**

```
npx tsc
```

**Creating the _tscofig.json_ file**

```
tsc --init
```

Types in JavaScipt
------------------

Every value in TypeScript has a type. It is just a cover that describes the properties and methods associated with it.

1.  Undefined: the set with only element _undefined_
2.  Null: the set with only _null_ element
3.  Boolean: the set with only _true_ or _false_
4.  Number: the set all numbers
5.  String: the set of all strings
6.  Symbol: the set of all symbols
7.  Object: the set of all objects
8.  BigInt: the set of all arbitrary-precision integers

These types are _dynamic_ types which means we can use them at run time. TypeScript has several other types in addition to these, static types.

Type _any_ in TypeScript
========================

When you don‚Äôt want a certain value to result in type-checking issues, you can use a special type `any` in TypeScript.

```
let person: any = { x: 0 };person.age()  
person()//here none of these will throw any error (only shows error when we run it)
```

This is not ideal and complements the features that typescript provides.

To fix the problem of referencing a property that doesn‚Äôt exist on an object, you do the following steps:

```
interface _person_{ id:_number_,age: _number_ ,name:_String_};function getPerson(_id_:_number_):_person_{return{id:_id_,age:23,name:"sai"}}
```

We explicitly use "person" as the return type of `getPerson()` function. When you try to access a property that never exists, it will show you an error message beforehand.

Type Annotation in TypeScript
-----------------------------

Type annotation helps to specify which type is associated with a particular variable.

For a clear exampleüëáüèª

In the case of Arrays and Object, you can use type followed by square. brackets.

```
let arrayNames: _string_\[\] = \["John", "Jane", "Mary"\];let NameObject:  {fname:_string_, lname:_string_}let names:typeof NameObject = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe"};
```

Function arguments & return types
---------------------------------

You can specify the type of arguments as well as the return type of arguments in TypeScript:

Output:

TypeScript Type Inference
-------------------------

Using the Type Interface we can infer types without Explicitly telling the types.

When you explicitly specify the type it is called type annotation on the other hand when Typescript decides the type it is called **type inference**.

TypeScript inference
--------------------

TypeScript infers the type when we don't explicitly specify the type. For Example `<h1>` is a heading element

Type inference occurs when you initialize variables, set parameter default values, and determine function return types. TypeScript uses its algorithm to find the best type for the variable.

TypeScript Number
-----------------

In TypeScript, all numbers are either large integers or floating-point values. While huge integers receive the type bigint, floating-point numbers have the type number.

TypeScript String
-----------------

Just like JavaScript, we can use `"‚Äù` or `'‚Äô` or ` `` ` to denote strings:

TypeScript Boolean
------------------

The two possible values for the TypeScript boolean type are true and false. It belongs to TypeScript‚Äôs primitive types.

TypeScript object
-----------------

The TypeScript `object` type represents all values that are not in primitive types.

Creating objects is like creating a template for variables, for example:

TypeScript Array Type
---------------------

An ordered list of data is a TypeScript array. You can declare an array with values of a certain type by using the syntax shown below:

You can also define a mixed type in TypeScript

TypeScript Enum
---------------

An enum is a group of named constant values. Enum stands for enumerated type.

TypeScript void Type
--------------------

The `void` type denotes the absence of having any type at all. It is a little like the opposite of the `any` type.

```
function warnUser(): _void_ {console.log("This is my warning message");}
```

Often we use `void` when we don't want to return anything from the function or methods.

TypeScript never Type
---------------------

The never type is a type that contains no values. Because of this, you cannot assign any value to a variable with a never type. The `never` type represents the return type of a function that always throws an error or a function that contains an indefinite loop.

TypeScript union Type
---------------------

The union type allows you to combine multiple types into one type.

TypeScript Type Aliases
-----------------------

You can give an existing type a new name by using type aliases. The type alias‚Äô syntax is displayed in the following way:

Introduction to TypeScript functions
------------------------------------

TypeScript functions are the building blocks of readable, maintainable, and reusable code.

If a function does not return a value, you can use the `void` type as the return type.

TypeScript Optional Parameters
------------------------------

Even if a function in JavaScript provides arguments, you can call it without sending any data. As a result, JavaScript by default accepts the optional parameters. TypeScript doesn't support these kinds of stuff.

In TypeScript, you can annotate optional parameters to tell the compiler that the parameter can be optional.

```
function draw(pen:boolean,paper:boolean,paint?:boolean){}
```

TypeScript Default Parameter
----------------------------

You can give default parameters to functions in typescript, if we provide the parameters then those will be used else it will use default values

```
function name(parameter1:type=defaultvalue1, parameter2:type=defaultvalue2,...) {  
   //  
}
```

TypeScript Rest Parameters
--------------------------

The rest parameter allows your function to accept zero or more arguments of the specified type.

TypeScript Classes
------------------

TypeScript sways the ES6 class syntax and adds type annotations to make the class more powerful.

Using access modifiers alters a class‚Äôs properties and methods‚Äô visibility. Three access modifiers are available in TypeScript:

> private : visibility in same class only
> 
> public : visibility in all locations
> 
> protected : visible within same class and subclasses

Another modifier that typescript provides is `readonly` .It allows you to mark the properties of a class immutable.

TypeScript abstract classes
---------------------------

An abstract class is used to define common behaviors for derived classes to extend. Unlike a regular [class](https://www.typescripttutorial.net/typescript-tutorial/typescript-class/), an abstract class cannot be instantiated directly.

One thing to note is that you always need to implement abstract methods in your deriving class or else the compiler will show an error. An Abstract class will have at least one abstract method.

TypeScript Intersection Types
-----------------------------

An intersection type creates a new type by combining multiple existing types. The new type has all features of the existing types.

TypeCasting in TypeScript
-------------------------

Variables have dynamic types, hence type casting is not a concept in JavaScript. But in TypeScript, each variable has a type. Variables can be changed from one type to another via type casting.

Typecasting using the ‚Äúas‚Äù keyword
----------------------------------

Sometimes typescript infers the best type for a particular variable and sometimes that might not be the intended type for that element. In that case, we can use the `as` keyword to typecast the type of that variable.

```
let input = document.querySelector('input\["type="text"\]');
```

You can see that we get an error saying value does not exist on type Element, this is because `querrySelector` will return a HTML Element and what we intended is a HTMLInputElement.

We can do this to overcome the same by using any of the following methods:

**using** `**as**`

```
  
let input = document.querySelector('input\["type="text"\]') as _HTMLInputElement_;
```

**using** `**<**> operator`

```
let input = <HTMLInputElement>document.querySelector('input\[type="text"\]');
```

Type casting allows you to convert a variable from one type to another.

There are more topics but most of the time you will only use what I have discussed above. 80% of what you will ever need will be 20% of what you learn.
